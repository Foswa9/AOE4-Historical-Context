        <p1>The Holy Roman Empire is a civilization shaped by a powerful infantry army, made stronger by the support of their religious unit â€” the Prelate.

        The Holy Roman Empire in Age of Empires IV spans the years 936-1517 CE. The empire, centered in a region that comprises modern Germany, claimed to be the rightful successor to the ancient Roman Empire. Its emperors controlled central Europe with a stalwart infantry of exuberant Landsknechte, and aimed to capture the center of the Christian world itself: Rome.
        
        In Age IV, the Holy Roman Empire stands out through their early access to religious units, available from the First Age onwards. Through careful use of the Prelate, players will be able to buff Villagers, speeding up their economic growth.</p1>
