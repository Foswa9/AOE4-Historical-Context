    <h1>How do you play as the HRE</h1>

    <p>
        <br>
        The game can be split into the different ages aswell as either in offence state or defence state.
        <br>
        HRE shine in the castle age and imperial age however it is still possible to win in earlier ages
        as can be seen by the pro players however simply out microing and macroring your opponent is usualy
        this tactic is possible
        <br>
        There are 3 ways to win the game. Playing as the HRE will affect the way you achieve these goals
        <br>
        1.Landmark victory, Defeat the enemy landmark is very obvious. The difficulty will be how to beat the enemies army
        who will be defending, while simultanously defending your own base + growing and protecting eco ,
        Although there is a lot of creativity involved, which is why this game is so beautful , however their are a few principles
        that will help you.  
        <br>
        The HRE most defining feature is their infantry. Their MAA 1. can be trained in the feudal age and 2. 
        have unique upgrades.
        They also have a unique unit known as the landknecht.
        <br>
        Another defining feauture is their religious unit known as the prelate. In their monastery/cathederal building 
        they have access unique upgrades. "Name goes here" acts as a permanent buff to all units when in the 
        aura of the religious unit.

        For the overview section a screen,not a seperate page just like what was does on aoeworld,almost like a cheetsheet will apear. maybe a 5 point diagram can appear. 
        The sections could be as follows ; Military(divided further in ; siege, infantry, calvalry, ranged), Economy(Villager production + throughput), 
        Technology(Eco + military effectivenes),

    <button>Unit composition</button>
    <!--
        What is the common unit composition 
    -->
    <br>
    <p>
        <!--Is there an easy and "fun" way to quickly show what unit counters what. At the same time having some sort of cheat displayed with all this relevant information
        
        Maybe having an icon showing what counters the unit in the icon and what the unit in the icon counters
        Also display their armour as it is a fundamental concept to learn. Archers are weak against heavily armoured. Crossbowmen and gunpowder counter heavy armour 
        and are good against unarmoured but are more expensive.
    
    -->
        Unit composition: A core concept of unit composition is building counters to what your opponent is building. So its wise to understand what unit counters what
        <br>
        The foundation rock,paper & scissor system:
        <br>
        Ranged counters Spearmen
        <br>
        Spearmen counter calvalry
        <br>
        Cavalry counters ranged
        <br>
        Gunpowder ranged & Crossbow counters heavy armoured units though are weak so should be protected.
        <br>
        All cavalry counter ranged units

        <br>
        Horsemen => Archers & crossbow men
        <br>
        Knights => Archers & crossbow men
        <br>
        MAA => have no obvious counter but as they are armoured so are not counter by archers
